**SYNTHesis**: A project from HackHer 2019 built by Elizabeth Carney, Sophia Hoenig, and Isabelle Hodge.

**Description**

We created a "build-your-own-song" machine! Press buttons to choose tracks (like drums, strings, sound effects, and more), and our Python program will compress them into one file, upload it to GitHub, and play it through the Bose speaker API. Expanding the use of the API, our circuit includes volume controls as well as a stop button. Depending on which tracks you choose, the LEDs on our colorful display will flash at different tempos along with the music. Enjoy our *synthesis* of art, technology, and music!

**Inspiration**

We are all huge fans of taking an interdisciplinary approach to technology, so this project was perfect for us.

**What it does**

Our project perfectly synthesizes music, art, and tech. SYNTHesis is interactive, allowing the user to create their own song using a variety of beats, melodies, and sound effects. The song is played via the Bose API, complete with volume and stop controls. LEDs flash to the tempo of the newly-created song!

**How we built it**

We divided up our task list while still working closely together.

**Challenges we ran into**

Our project combines tons of different softwares, packages, and APIs, so it was really challenging to get them to cooperate with one another.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We are truly proud of using the Bose API, the beautifully efficient wiring of our circuits, and getting the Arduino to push to GitHub via Python script!

**What we learned**

So much! We learned how to incorporate APIs into projects, how to code for Arduino and GitHub in Python, and more!

**What's next**

We would love to expand on our project by adding even more features, such as the ability to create your own beat by tapping a touchpad.

**Built with**

We used pyfirmata to code Arduino through Python, pygithub to upload files automatically through Arduino, the Bose API to control song playback, and more!

Many thanks to our mentors from Bose, especially Sushma Kattinti!
